* A tool for parsing text based Age of Empires 4 build order

** Getting Started

Disclaimer: Work in progress, feel free to add more functionality and
fix some bugs.

- Install [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README][Stack]]

- Create a sample build order file, for example, in ~/tmp/build-order.txt~

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  # Basic build order
  8 2 2 2 0 00:01 Villager
  8 2 2 2 0 00:03 Villager,Archer
  8 2 2 2 0 00:10 Villager, Cannon
  #+END_SRC

- Run the following command

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack run -- --input /tmp/build-order.txt --outdir /tmp
  Parsed Build Order: Right (BuildOrder [Comment "# Basic build order",BuildStep {vTotal = 8, vFood = 2, vWood = 2, vGold = 2, vStone = 0, timestamp = 1, units = [Unit "Villager"]},BuildStep {vTotal = 8, vFood = 2, vWood = 2, vGold = 2, vStone = 0, timestamp = 3, units = [Unit "Villager",Unit "Archer"]},BuildStep {vTotal = 8, vFood = 2, vWood = 2, vGold = 2, vStone = 0, timestamp = 10, units = [Unit "Villager",Unit " Cannon"]}])
  #+END_SRC
